# About
Frontend for a survey for a client, Bannerman Wealth.  The purpose of the survey is to allow clients to self-select into categories based on their responses.  Their resulting category will place them into one of a variety of email campaigns which offer information based on their category and/or an invitation to meet with a member of Bannerman Wealth.

After completing the survey, the user is asked to enter their name and email.  A score has been calculated in the background which places them in a category.  Both are hidden from the user unless and until they enter their name and email.  Upon submission, the name, email and category are sent to the client's email service, currently ConvertKit <convertkit.com>.

In the project folder, there are both backend and serverless folder.  These were made during development but are no longer used.  ConvertKit's API allows direct sending of the necessary information with an acceptable level of security for this project.
